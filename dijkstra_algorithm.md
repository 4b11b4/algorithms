# Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Finds shortest path between nodes in a graph.
* Conceived in 1956.
* Variants:
  1. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two nodes.
  2. A more common variant chooses a node as the source node and then finds
the shortest path to all nodes, producing the shortest-path tree.

## Implementation
### Priority Queue
Running time complexity improves to: $$ O() $$
