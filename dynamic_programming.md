# Dynamic Programming
* Helpful to think of pseudo-code where you will be writing...
  - "some function you want to maximize"
* The hardest part is coming up with this function.

## Approaches
###Top-Down
* Memoization: whenever you calculate something, store it

### Bottom-Up
* Also store things... but do so by a "bottom up approach" (or making
  calculations starting with the "leaf nodes").
